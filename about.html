					<h2>OUR APPROACH</h2>
					<p>Interior design is more than the simple making of a room, it is the result of an intimate collaboration between designer and client. Together they create spaces that allow for living and working—beautifully.</p>
 					<p>Philpotts and Associates' designers strive to give integrity and credibility to every project they undertake. The spaces they help create blend the sophisticated grace of East and West with respect for our natural elements. Indoors and outdoors mesh seamlessly, creating a total environment that is at once current and timeless.</p>
 					<p>Our designers help each client create an environmental identity—one that takes a 360 degree view of every project. Together we come up with that sense of place for you, whatever that place may be, whether it’s in a rainforest in Costa Rica, or an old beach resort on the California coast.</p>
 					<p>We look at the social, site and geographical aspects of each project when working with our clients. The end product comes from a collaboration of a team, including local resource people. Philpotts designers take the lessons learned in Hawaii about integrating design, culture and community and apply those same lessons to each project we take on.</p>
					<p>Our approach to every environment is to immerse ourselves to the degree that the result is never a packaged formula. This way of looking at design gives added value to every client. We know that what is truly indigenous is always more sustainable in the long run.</p>

						<h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
						<p>Founder Mary Philpotts McGrath began her design business from a storefront in Honolulu in the 1960s. Her goal was to give the newly constructed buildings and residences that were springing up everywhere "a sense of place." This meant reinterpreting the culture and color of the islands in a changing environment.</p>
						<p>Principals Marion Philpotts-Miller and Lowell Tom later joined the highly successful firm, working from Honolulu and San Francisco. Today, the principals and designers of Philpotts Interiors continue to move the company forward.</p>
						<p>With a focus in Hawaii and beyond the islands to the mainland U.S., Asia and the Pacific, Philpotts infuses a fresh, modern energy into their design work.</p>
