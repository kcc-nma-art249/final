<h1>About</h1>

<p>HI-FRUCTOSE is a quarterly print art magazine, founded by artists, Attaboy and Annie Owens in 2005. HI-FRUCTOSE focuses squarely on the art which transcends genre and trend, assuring readers thorough coverage and content that is informative and original.
HI-FRUCTOSE showcases an amalgamation of new contemporary, emerging as well distinguished artists, with a spotlight on awe inspiring spectacles from round the world.
HI-FRUCTOSE goes beyond the comfort zone of the “alternative” norm to deliver a diverse cross section of the most influential, genre bending art of our time as well as breaking new and amazing talents.
Readers of HI-FRUCTOSE are seeking to satisfy their cravings for new and unique art: HI-FRUCTOSE informs, rather follows trends in mainstream media including film, fashion and design.</p>
